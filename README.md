# Goofy Web SSH client (Websocket)

A web based client for ssh over websockets.

Meant to be used as a web alternative for the [Goofy Websocket SSH Client](https://github.com/marceldobehere/Goofy-SSH) and used with the [Goofy Websocket Socket Bridge](https://github.com/marceldobehere/Goofy-Websocket-Socket-Bridge).


You can statically host the site or just download and open it locally.
